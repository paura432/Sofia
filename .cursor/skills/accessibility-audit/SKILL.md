name: accessibility-audit
description: Runs a WCAG 2.2 accessibility audit of a screenshot, URL, or HTML/JSX and reports findings by severity (P0 blocks use, P1 degrades use, P2 friction), each with a success-criterion citation. Use for "check accessibility", "run an a11y audit", "is this WCAG compliant", "is this accessible", or "audit contrast and keyboard support". Skip for axe-core/Lighthouse scans or legal ADA/Section 508 certification - this is expert review, not a scanner.

Load `sofia-editorial-ux` first. Prefer correct HTML over unnecessary ARIA. Review i18n language switch, media controls, reduced motion, and ES/EN content parity.

# Accessibility audit

## Step 1: identify the input

Determine what was actually provided before checking anything:

- **A screenshot or image** - proceed with screenshot-only scope (see Step 3).
- **A URL** - fetch the page if a fetch tool is available, and use the rendered HTML as the source of truth. If a screenshot of the page is also available, use both. If no fetch tool is available, ask the user to paste the page's HTML instead of guessing at markup.
- **HTML, JSX, or another markup/component snippet** - read it directly as the source of truth.
- **Anything else** (a plain description, a Figma link with no exported image, a vague "check our app") - stop and ask for a screenshot, URL, or markup. Do not guess at a UI you cannot see.

If more than one input type is given (for example a URL plus a screenshot of one of its states), use both and check against the wider scope.

## Step 2: read the checklist

Before evaluating anything, read `references/wcag22-checklist.md`. It lists all 18 success criteria this audit checks, one line each: SC number, name, level, whether a screenshot alone can verify it, and what to look for. Re-read it on every audit, even a second one in the same session, so criteria don't quietly drop out of memory.

## Criteria this audit covers

| SC | Name | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 | Non-text content | A |
| 1.3.1 | Info and relationships | A |
| 1.4.3 | Contrast minimum | AA |
| 1.4.4 | Resize text | AA |
| 1.4.10 | Reflow | AA |
| 1.4.11 | Non-text contrast | AA |
| 2.1.1 | Keyboard | A |
| 2.1.2 | No keyboard trap | A |
| 2.4.4 | Link purpose (in context) | A |
| 2.4.6 | Headings and labels | AA |
| 2.4.7 | Focus visible | AA |
| 2.4.11 | Focus not obscured (minimum) - new in WCAG 2.2 | AA |
| 2.5.8 | Target size (minimum) - new in WCAG 2.2 | AA |
| 3.2.2 | On input | A |
| 3.3.1 | Error identification | A |
| 3.3.2 | Labels or instructions | A |
| 3.3.8 | Accessible authentication (minimum) - new in WCAG 2.2 | AA |
| 4.1.2 | Name, role, value | A |

See `references/wcag22-checklist.md` for what to look for under each one.

## Step 3: separate what the input can prove from what it can't

This is the rule that keeps the audit honest. Never claim a pass or a fail on a criterion the input cannot demonstrate.

**Every criterion leaves the audit somewhere.** All 18 in the table above must end up in exactly one of the four homes defined under Output format: a finding under P0, P1, or P2; the scope line, for a criterion that was checked and came back clean; "Suppressed at this depth", for a criterion whose finding the requested depth withholds; or a line under "Not verifiable from this input". A criterion in none of the four has been dropped, and a dropped criterion reads as a silent pass, which is the one thing this step exists to prevent. The homes are not interchangeable: a criterion that was checked and passed belongs on the scope line and never in the ledger, which says the input could not reach it. The three groups below are exhaustive and add up to 18; anything you cannot place in the first two belongs in the third.

From a **screenshot alone**, you CAN check (5 criteria):

- 1.4.3 contrast minimum - measure the rendered text and background colors.
- 1.4.11 non-text contrast - measure icons, borders, and visible focus indicators.
- 2.4.6 headings and labels - confirm headings and form labels are visually present and make sense out of context.
- 2.5.8 target size - measure tappable element dimensions against the 24x24 CSS px minimum, when the viewport scale is known or stated.
- 3.3.2 labels or instructions - confirm visible instructions exist next to inputs that need them.

From a **screenshot alone**, you can check these only when the matching state was supplied (7 criteria). Check what the image actually shows, and put the rest under "Not verifiable from this input" naming the state you would need:

- 1.3.1 info and relationships - a visible heading hierarchy, list, or table is readable from the pixels; whether the DOM carries the same relationships is not.
- 1.4.4 resize text - needs a screenshot of the page at 200% text size. One image at the default size cannot show whether content clips, overlaps, or stays usable when text scales.
- 1.4.10 reflow - needs a screenshot at a 320px-wide viewport. One image at one width says nothing about whether the layout reflows to a single column without horizontal scrolling.
- 2.4.4 link purpose - link text and its surrounding sentence are visible; purpose that depends on programmatic context is not.
- 2.4.7 focus visible and 2.4.11 focus not obscured - both need a focus-state screenshot.
- 3.3.1 error identification - needs an error-state screenshot, and then shows only whether the error is described in text rather than by color alone.

From a **screenshot alone**, you CANNOT check, and must list under "Not verifiable from this input" (6 criteria):

- 1.1.1 non-text content (alt text lives in the DOM, not the pixels).
- 2.1.1 / 2.1.2 keyboard behavior and keyboard traps.
- 3.2.2 on input, 3.3.8 accessible authentication - both need interaction or a flow, not a static image.
- 4.1.2 name, role, value (needs the accessibility tree).

From **HTML, JSX, or a fetched page**, check all 18 directly against the markup: alt attributes, heading and landmark structure, label associations, ARIA roles and states, tabindex and focus-management code, and any inline color values you can resolve to compute contrast. If CSS is not included, contrast and target size still fall into "not verifiable" unless computed values are given.

## Step 4: assign severity

- **P0 - blocks use.** A user cannot complete the task at all. Missing accessible name on a primary action, a keyboard trap, contrast so low the text is unreadable, a form control with no label at all.
- **P1 - degrades use.** The task is possible but harder. Contrast below the AA threshold but still legible, missing visible focus indicator, a target below the 24x24 CSS px minimum, vague link text ("click here") with no surrounding context.
- **P2 - friction.** Minor confusion or inefficiency. Inconsistent heading levels, low contrast on a decorative element, redundant instructions.

## Step 5: write each finding

Every finding needs three parts, in this order:

1. **Observed** - what you actually saw or read, not an inference. ("The 'Submit' button renders white text (#FFFFFF) on a #7A9CC6 background.")
2. **Fix** - concrete, not generic. ("Darken the background to #3D5A80 or below to reach a 4.5:1 ratio against white text.")
3. **Citation** - `WCAG 2.2 SC <number> (<name>, Level <A/AA>)`.

## Output format

Use exactly this structure:

```
# Accessibility audit: <name or URL of what was reviewed>

**Input type:** screenshot | URL | HTML/JSX
**Scope:** <one line on what was actually checked>

## P0 - blocks use
1. **<short title>**
   - Observed: <fact>
   - Fix: <concrete fix>
   - WCAG 2.2 SC <x.x.x> (<name>, Level <A/AA>)

## P1 - degrades use
(same structure)

## P2 - friction
(same structure)

## Not verifiable from this input
- <SC number and name> - requires <HTML / URL / keyboard test / focus-state screenshot>

## Suppressed at this depth
(only when the request limited the report to P0 - omit this heading otherwise)
- <SC number and name> - <P1 / P2> finding found, write-up withheld at the requested depth

## Scope note
This is an expert-review pass against WCAG 2.2, not a substitute for testing with people who use assistive technology, and not a legal ADA or Section 508 compliance certification.
```

Omit a severity section entirely when it has zero findings - do not pad it with "no issues found" filler under a heading that implies problems exist. Always include "Not verifiable from this input" when the input is a screenshot; when the audit covered HTML/JSX/URL end to end, write "None - full markup was available" instead of omitting the section. Include "Suppressed at this depth" only when the request limited the output depth, and never as a stand-in for a severity section that genuinely had no findings - an omitted section says there was nothing to report, which is the opposite of what suppression means. Always include the scope note.

"Not verifiable from this input" is the ledger that makes Step 3 checkable. Every one of the 18 criteria is accounted for exactly once, across four places: a finding under P0, P1, or P2; the scope line, for a criterion that was checked and came back clean; "Suppressed at this depth", for a criterion that produced a finding the requested depth withholds; or this ledger, for a criterion the input could not reach. A criterion in none of the four has been dropped silently. On a screenshot audit the ledger normally holds 13 criteria - the 7 partial ones whose matching state was not supplied, plus the 6 a static image can never reach - so a short ledger is the symptom of criteria going missing, not of a clean screen. Group entries on one line where they share a reason (`1.4.4 / 1.4.10 Resize text and reflow - need a 200% text-size screenshot and a 320px-wide one`) rather than dropping them to keep the report tidy.

## Edge cases

- **Multiple screens or states in one screenshot** - audit each one under its own `##` subheading inside the same report, rather than merging findings across screens.
- **A screenshot with an unknown scale** - target size is defined in CSS pixels, but a screenshot from a 2x or 3x display stores device pixels, so a 44 CSS px button arrives 88 or 132 px wide in the file. Measuring 2.5.8 straight off image pixels turns a comfortable target into a violation, and the same arithmetic the other way hides a real one. Ask for the device pixel ratio or the CSS viewport width, or derive the ratio from a known device width (a 1170 px wide iPhone screenshot is 390 CSS px at 3x). Until the scale is settled, 2.5.8 goes under "Not verifiable from this input". Contrast is unaffected - colors do not change with scale.
- **Text over a photo, gradient, or video background** - do not estimate a pass. File a P1 finding for indeterminate contrast and recommend testing the worst-case pixel region against the text color.
- **A component with no visible content** (empty state, loading skeleton) - note it and ask whether a populated state is available, since several criteria (headings, labels, link purpose) cannot be judged from an empty shell.
- **HTML/JSX with inline styles or unresolved CSS variables** - treat contrast and target size as not verifiable rather than guessing computed values.
- **A "quick check" or "just the big ones" request** - still run the full criteria list, still write up P0 in full, and hold back the P1 and P2 write-ups. Depth limits what a finding says, never whether the report admits one exists: every criterion that produced a withheld finding gets one line under "Suppressed at this depth" naming its SC number and the tier it landed in, and the scope line says the depth was limited. The other two moves are both illegal. Dropping those criteria leaves them in none of the four homes, and a criterion that leaves the report silently reads as a pass - the fastest way this audit can certify a screen it actually failed. Putting them on the scope line is worse, because that line is reserved for criteria that were checked and came back clean, and a withheld finding is not clean. Offer to write up any suppressed line on request.
- **A second audit of the same screen after fixes** - re-run the full process; do not assume prior findings still hold.

## Failure modes to avoid

- Do not invent a contrast ratio you did not compute from actual colors.
- Do not mark a criterion "pass" because nothing looked obviously wrong - if it was not checked, it is "not verifiable," not a pass.
- Do not let a criterion leave the report without landing in one of the four homes: a severity section, the scope line as checked and clean, the suppressed roster, or the not-verifiable ledger. Silence is the most convincing false pass this audit can produce, because nothing in the output points at the gap. Do not file a criterion that was checked and passed under the ledger either - the ledger claims the input could not reach it, and that claim would be false.
- Do not cite a WCAG success criterion you have not actually checked against.
- Do not soften a P0 finding into P1 to make a report read better.
